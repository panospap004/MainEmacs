Non-nil if Ivy-File-Preview mode is enabled.

for a description of this minor mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')
or call the function `ivy-file-preview-mode'.")

Minor mode 'ivy-file-preview-mode'.

This is a global minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Ivy-File-Preview mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive,
enable the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable the
mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable the mode
if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `(default-value \\='ivy-file-preview-mode)'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it is
disabled.
