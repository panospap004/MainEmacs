* Headers
you use * to make headers the more you type the more yo go in 
you can also press tab to fold 1 header all shift tab to fold all headers and each shift tab after that it will unflold all by 1 level
* Markdown  
like syntax
you can do *bold using ** /italic using // _underline using __ +cut using ++ and highlight using either = or ~ =highlight=  ~highlight~ like in markdown
+ spot with 1 +

*for more link inserts see the spc-o-l keybind*

also you can make internal links using *<< >>* like this <<earlier heading>> to link to the text then you use *[[text] ]* with the same text to make the link like this 
example <<link>>

# for comments
* Footnotes (link to bottom of page)
Here is a sentence with a footnote.[fn:1] [fn:1 ] this is how you make a footnote without the space after the 1
(you can go back and fourth bettween the footnote using ctrl+c ctrl+c)
* TODO todo and done headers
to add todos you can use the keybind spc-o-t then t for todo or any other key recomended by the pop up menu
you can list all the todos in a project with Spc-o-L

* Code block
#+begin_src cpp
    #include <iostream>

    int main(void){
      std::cout << std::endl;
    }
#+end_src

* Different blocks
you can add a lost of blocks with the keybind spc-o-ctrl+i for example 

#+begin_quote
a quote block
#+end_quote

#+begin_example
an example block
#+end_example

#+begin_Custom block
a custom block
#+end_Custom

etc

* DONE the done header 
you can pres shift+right_arrow/left_arrow to go through your todo etc list 

* TAGS                                                            :personal:
you can add tags to your headers with the keybind spc-o-T then select the tag you want or add a new one tags are usually combined with todos and agenda to seperate them even more 

** for more detailed and real todos use the keybind spc-o-n and chose from the options

* Agenda
you can access the agenda from spc-o-a and then which view you want best on the spc-o-n todos you made 

* mermaid diagrams
you can create diagrams with mermaid syntax to make the src block the keybind is <cd and to run it to create the image file you do ctrl+c ctrl+c on the src block

#+begin_src mermaid :file test.png

A[Hard] -->|Text| B(Round)

* krita images 

or you can make custom krita images with the spc-o-Ctrl+d keybind then click on the image to open it in krita and draw  

[[krita:/home/pappanos/.config/MainEmacs/Files-org/test.kra][test]]

* LaTeX equations
you can make single line latex with $ equation $ or multi line with $$ equation $$ and to run it you press the keybind SPC-o-ctrl+l (you will need to have installed sudo pacman -S texlive for this to work)

$$
P\left(A=2 \,\middle|\, \frac{A^2}{B}>4\right)
$$

* Org-tranclusion 
to start org-tranclusion see the keybinds under the SPC-o-Ctrl+t prefix {i have witch key so wait for the pop up menu}
you can include other files or section of files with org-tranclusion like this 
**** this adds the whole file
#+ transclude:[ [./Files-org/TEST.org]] {without the space after the + and [} 
#+transclude: [[./Files-org/NOTES.org]]

**** this adds a specific section of the file this time the WORK section
#+ transclude:[ [./Files-org/NOTES.org::* WORK]] {without the space after the + and [}
#+transclude: [[./Files-org/NOTES.org::* WORK]]

**** this adds only the content under the header 
#+ transclude:[ [./Files-org/NOTES.org::* WORK]] :only-contents {without the space after the + and [}
#+transclude: [[./Files-org/NOTES.org::* WORK]] :only-contents

**** this adds a code block from a file with specific lines
the :src c part makes it so that it will format the code as c code in a c src block
the :line works like this 1 == the line with the word you specified like in the below header - = til what point and the secont number shows how many lines if a number is not specified it will go to the end of the file
#+ transclude:[ [./Files-org/main.c]] :lines 1-5 :src c
#+transclude: [[./Files-org/main.c]] :lines 1-5 :src c

**** this adds a specific function and everything under it
#+transclude: [[file:./Files-org/main.c::main][main function]] :lines 1- :src c :end "addF"

if you have 2 lines that are similar you will need to add the whole line to make it clear for example 
int add(int a, int b);
int add(int a, int b) {
i have to add lines in my code so i cant just type add since it will select the first one it finds so i need to give it the line till a character that is diffrent
#+transclude: [[file:./Files-org/main.c::int add(int a, int b) {][main function]]  :src c

alternative you could create a commend and specify that comment to transclude

#+transclude: [[file:./Files-org/main.c::addF][main function]]  :src c

and if you dont want the comment to show you can use the :line 
#+transclude: [[file:./Files-org/main.c::addF][main function]] :lines 2- :src c

**** add a specific funtion with an end point 
you can use the :end and make a custom commend in a file to specify where to stop transcluding so you can add a specific function only without specific lines in case it grows or shrinks
#+transclude: [[file:Files-org/main.c::main]] :lines 1- :src c :end "mainE"
