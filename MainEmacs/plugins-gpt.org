> **Feature gaps & combos:**  
> - A few Neovim plugins (e.g. `oatmeal.nvim`, `snacks.nvim`) have no direct one‑to‑one in Emacs; Emacs’s built‑ins or small utility libraries cover most of their functionality.  
> - Where Neovim uses separate packages for LSP install, DAP install, etc., Emacs often bundles these in **lsp-mode**, **dap-mode**, or via **use-package** + **straight.el**.
